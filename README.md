# Search Engine 

This project showcases a basic search engine **built over the course of 3 weeks** from scratch following the basic principles of **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. The project constitutes of three core components: **a crawler, an indexer and a querier** - each developed independently in the span of a week. The `requirements`, `design` and `implementation` specifications of each of these modules are present in their respective folders. I submitted this project as the main individual submission of Dartmouth College CS50.   

## Tools and frameworks used

In order to implement this project, I learned and used:

1. `valgrind` - for testing memory leaks
2. `gdb` - for debugging 
3. `bash`- for command line operations and scripting
4. `git` - for version control and GitHub integration
5. `C` - for implementing core functionalities
6. `Markdown` - for formatting README, Requirements, Design and Implementation.

## Contents in this repository

1. a `common` - folder shared by crawler, indexer and querier
2. `crawler`, `indexer' and 'querier' folders
3. `libcs50` - a library with basic data structures, a `webpage` module, a `file` module and a `mem` module
4. a `.gitignore` file
5. a `Makefile` file
6. some testing folders
